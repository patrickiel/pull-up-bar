# Pull-up bar
Personalized and ergonomic pull-up bar for ceiling mounting

## Why dont buy one?
I was not satisfied with the commercial ceiling mount pull-up bars. Therefore, I decided to build my own pull-up bar. For me there were the following requirements:
- Ergonomics, every person is different. I wanted to build a pull-up bar, adapted to my body. But here you can also find plans that fit youre body (further down in the instructions).
- Dismountable, it should be able to be quickly dismount it after the workout.
- Flexible handles, it should be possible to grip narrow, wide and medium.
- Resistance band, it should be possible to attach a resistance band.
- Reuse existing hooks, it should be possible to attach the unit to the same hooks as the gymnastic rings. For the rings, the standard distance is 50 cm.
