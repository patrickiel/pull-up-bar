# Pull-up bar
Personalized and ergonomic pull-up bar for ceiling mounting

## Why don't buy one?
I decided to build my own pull-up bar because I was not satisfied with the commercial ceiling mounted pull-up bars. For me there where the following requirements:
- Ergonomics, every person is different. I wanted to build a pull-up bar, adapted to my body. But here you can also find plans that fit youre body (further down in the instructions).
- Dismountable, it should be able to be quickly dismount it after the workout.
- Flexible handles, it should be possible to grip narrow, wide and medium.
- Resistance band, it should be possible to attach a resistance band.
- Minimally invasive, I live in a rental apartment and want to damage the ceiling as little as possible. It should be possible to attach the unit to the same hooks as the gymnastic rings. For the rings, the standard distance is 50 cm.

# Biacromial breadth
Based on this study https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662157/, the optimal grip width is 1-2 times the biacromial breadth. A medium grip (1.5 times the biacromial width) may have some minor advantages over small and wide grips. The pull-up bar is designed to allow grips only between single and double the width of the biacromial breadth. Each biacromial breadth has its own construction plan, so you can measure your biacromial breadth and download the corresponding plan.

# Build instructions
## Needed tools
- Jigsaw
- Router
- Drill
- Sandpaper
- Tape measure

## Materials
- Plywood, dimensions according to the plan (I used two panels half the thickness and glued them together)
- Fastening material (shackles or rope, hooks, carabiners)

## Choose the right plan
Measure your biacromial breadth, there are multiple online instructions.
Go to [pull-up bar variants](cad/pull-up%20bar%20variants) and choose the right PDF-file

## Print the plan
If you have a standard printer you can use the tiling feature of your favourite PDF Reader to print the second sheet of the pdf to multiple small sheets and align them using the marks.
Transfer the contour to the plywood, cut it, use the router to round off the edges, sand it, hang it.
