# Pull-up bar
Personalized and ergonomic pull-up bar for ceiling mounting

## Why don't buy one?
I was not satisfied with the commercial ceiling mount pull-up bars. Therefore, I decided to build my own pull-up bar. For me there were the following requirements:
- Ergonomics, every person is different. I wanted to build a pull-up bar, adapted to my body. But here you can also find plans that fit youre body (further down in the instructions).
- Dismountable, it should be able to be quickly dismount it after the workout.
- Flexible handles, it should be possible to grip narrow, wide and medium.
- Resistance band, it should be possible to attach a resistance band.
- Reuse existing hooks, it should be possible to attach the unit to the same hooks as the gymnastic rings. For the rings, the standard distance is 50 cm.

# Biacromial breadth
Based on this study https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662157/, the optimal grip width is 1-2 times the biacromial breadth. A medium grip (1.5 times the biacromial width) may have some minor advantages over small and wide grips. The pull-up bar is designed to allow grips only between single and double the width of the biacromial breadth. Each biacromial breadth has its own construction plan, so you can measure your biacromial breadth and download the corresponding plan.
