# Custom pull-up bar

## The Idea
An ergonomic pull-up bar for ceiling mounting, which works well in combination with gymnastic rings.

## Why not buy one?
I decided to build my own pull-up bar because I was not satisfied with the commercially available ceiling mounted pull-up bars. I had the following requirements:
- Ergonomics: Everyone's body is unique. I wanted to create a pull-up bar that fits my body, and yours. You can find a custom drawing that fits your body shape below in the instructions.
- Dismountable: After the workout, the bar should be easy to remove.
- Adjustable grip positions: Narrow, medium and wide grip.
- Resistance Band Friendly: There should be a place to attach a resistance band.
- Minimal damage: Living in a rental apartment, I wanted to minimize damage to the ceiling. The unit hat to be able to mount on the same hooks as the gymnastic rings, which typically have a standard spacing of 50 cm.

## Biacromial breadth
Based on this study https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662157/, the optimal grip width is 1-2 times the biacromial breadth. A medium grip (1.5 times the biacromial width) may have some minor advantages over small and wide grips. This pull-up bar is designed to allow ony grips within this range.

# Build instructions

## Choose the plan
Measure your biacromial breadth (search for an online instruction) and choose the corresponding PDF-file [pull-up bar variants](cad/pull-up%20bar%20variants) 

## Tools
- Jigsaw
- Router
- Drill
- Sandpaper
- Tape Measure

## Materials
- Plywood
- Mounting materials (shackles or rope, hooks, carabiners)

## Build it
- If you're using a standard printer, use the tiling feature of your preferred PDF reader to print the second sheet of the PDF on several smaller sheets. Align these using the marks.
- Transfer the outline to the plywood and cut it out.
- Use your router to mill the edges, then sand.
- Mount it to your ceiling.
