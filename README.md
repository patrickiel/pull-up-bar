# Pull-up bar
Personalized and ergonomic pull-up bar for ceiling mounting.

## Why not buy one?
I decided to build my own pull-up bar because I was not satisfied with the commercial ceiling mounted pull-up bars. For me, there were the following requirements:
- Ergonomics: Each person's physical characteristics are unique. I aimed to create a pull-up bar tailored to my physique. You can find a customizable plan suited to your body shape further down in the instructions.
- Dismountable: It should be easy to dismount the bar after completing the workout.
- Adjustable grip positions: It should provide for narrow, medium, and wide grip options.
- Resistance band-friendly: There should be a provision to attach a resistance band.
- Minimal damage: Since I live in a rented apartment, I wanted to inflict minimal damage on the ceiling. The unit should be mountable on the same hooks as the gymnastic rings, which typically have a standard distance of 50 cm.

# Biacromial breadth
Based on this study https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662157/, the optimal grip width is 1-2 times the biacromial breadth. A medium grip (1.5 times the biacromial width) may have some minor advantages over small and wide grips. This pull-up bar is designed to allow grip widths ranging between one and two times your biacromial breadth. You can select a construction plan correlating with your biacromial breadth measurement. To do this, measure your biacromial breadth and download the plan that matches your size.

# Build instructions
## Needed tools
- Jigsaw
- Router
- Drill
- Sandpaper
- Tape Measure

## Materials
- Plywood (dimensions as per the selected plan; I coulnd't find a panel of the desired thickness so I bought two panels of half the thickness and glued them together)
- Mounting materials (shackles or rope, hooks, carabiners)

## Choose the right plan
Measure your biacromial breadth, search for an online instruction.
Go to [pull-up bar variants](cad/pull-up%20bar%20variants) and choose the corresponding PDF-file

## Print the plan
If you're using a standard printer, use the tiling feature of your preferred PDF Reader to print the second sheet of the PDF across multiple smaller sheets. Align these using the marks provided.
Next, transfer the outline to the plywood and cut it out. Use the router to round off the edges, sand it to smoothness, and finally, mount it onto your ceiling.
